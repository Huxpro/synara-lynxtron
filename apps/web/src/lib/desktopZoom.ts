// FILE: desktopZoom.ts
// Purpose: Single renderer-side accessor for the Electron shell's page zoom factor.
// Layer: Web shell utility
// Depends on: the platform window adapter (desktopBridge in Electron), shared desktop chrome geometry.
//
// Why this exists:
//   Zoom is the conversion factor between the renderer's CSS pixels and the window
//   DIPs that native surfaces (traffic lights, the native browser WebContentsView)
//   are positioned in. Every consumer needs the same defensive read — the preload
//   bridge can be absent (web build) or predate the zoom channel — so the read and
//   the subscription live here instead of being re-derived per call site.

 * Subscribe to shell zoom changes. Returns an unsubscribe function; when the bridge
 * cannot report zoom the listener simply never fires.
